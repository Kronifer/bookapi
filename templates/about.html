	<p>     I created Bookapi not because I had a vision, but simply because I was bored. I set out to create an easy to use API
		to keep track of one of my favorite things, books.</p>

	<p>Bookapi is prgrammed and hosted on <a href=https://repl.it>repl.it</a>, a great website for hosting web apps, discord bots and the like.</p>

    <p>If you're interested in helping me with developing Bookapi, feel free to open a pull request on the <a href=https://github.com/kronifer/bookapi/>Github repo</a>.
